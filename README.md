# Air Quality Data Analysis and Temperature Forecasting

This project analyzes air quality data and uses the Prophet library to forecast temperature.

Project Overview
This notebook demonstrates the process of loading, preprocessing, and analyzing air quality data. It specifically focuses on using the Prophet time series forecasting model to predict temperature based on historical data. The project includes steps for handling missing values, preparing data for Prophet, training the model, making predictions, and evaluating the model's performance.

Data
The data used in this project is the Air Quality UCI dataset. It contains hourly measurements of air pollutants and meteorological parameters.
